Welcome to the README of our Internal Social Networking Platform! This document provides an in-depth overview of our platform's features, architecture, technologies, setup instructions, usage guidelines, contributing information, and licensing details.

### Introduction

Our Internal Social Networking Platform is a powerful tool designed to enhance communication, collaboration, and information sharing within companies. Built as a full-stack application using Ruby on Rails 7, the platform leverages the capabilities of MeiliSearch for efficient and accurate search functionality. With a user-centric approach, personalized feeds, and support for various media types, our platform offers a comprehensive solution for internal networking and engagement.

### Features

#### 1. Personalized Feeds
Users are greeted with personalized feeds that curate company messages, posts, and important links tailored to their interests and interactions. This ensures that users receive content that is relevant to their roles and preferences.

#### 2. Efficient Search
Our platform is integrated with MeiliSearch, a powerful search engine that enables lightning-fast content discovery. Users can effortlessly search for posts, messages, links, and other content, ensuring that they can quickly access the information they need.

#### 3. Access Control
Admin users are empowered with additional privileges that enable them to manage posts, users, and vital resources. This hierarchy of access control ensures efficient content moderation and user management.

#### 4. Company-Centric Structure
With a focus on scalability and flexibility, our platform is scoped by company. This means that each company has its own space for discussions, posts, and interactions, maintaining a clear separation between different organizations.
